## Would You Rather?

## Project Overview

Would You Rather? is the second project in the Udacity React Nanodegree. It is designed to teach students how to handle state management using Redux.

This application presents the user with a list of poll questions and allows them to create their own polls. Answering and creating polls is rewarded with points.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Installation

First, you need to clone this file to your local machine, which you can do by running the command:
### `git clone https://github.com/markyz89/would-you-rather.git`

You should then run 
### `npm install` 
to install the project's dependencies.

Once installed, to start the application, you can run:

### `npm start`

Which runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Usage

Log into the application by selecting one of the three available users. In order to see any of the content, you must be logged in.

Upon login you will see a list of unanswered questions by default. You can answer any of these questions by clicking on view poll and selecting an answer. The poll will then be moved to the answered questions tab. You can navigate back to the list of questions by clicking on Home.

The New question button in the naviation bar allows you to create your own question. Simply fill in both of your alternatives in the two text inputs provided and hit submit to register your question.

Finally the Leaderboard button will show how you rank against the other users. Answer and create more questions to get to the top of that leaderboard!
